            nicludepot - n1clud3's raspberry pi server programmed using
            <a href="https://rust-lang.org">Rust</a> and <a href="https://rocket.rs">Rocket</a>.
            Goal of nicludepot for me (n1clud3) is learn to write programs in Rust.

        <p>
            By the way, I would like to talk about the purposes of GitHub website and nicludepot.
            
            I use my GitHub webiste to publish information, usually information about my applications.
            I use nicludepot to publish web services, APIs and such.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fact: my pi receives nicludepot updates thru github repository.
